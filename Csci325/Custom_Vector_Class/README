In this project your team will be implementing a float_vector class in
float_vector.cpp and float_vector.h.  Please try to follow the documentation
standards implied by the other files (document each file, class, and method).

You must compile and link each of the files separately.  Compile with:

(Compile each individual file to object code)
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ -c gradebook.cpp
g++ -c float_vector.cpp

(Link object files to form executable gradebook)
g++ float_vector.o gradebook.o main.o -o gradebook
